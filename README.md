## Hi, I'm Ali Haider 👋🏽

I'm a full-stack developer who loves making open-source contributions easy, building technology that helps people, and creating a strong community. I enjoy developing great front-ends and powerful back-ends. Some technologies I work with include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Laravel, MySQL, and APIs.
